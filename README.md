[6/28/17, 2:30:49 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: 2 bkg, 1 sig, a few variables, controlled stats
[6/28/17, 2:31:15 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: we can control the modeling too at some point add syst
[6/28/17, 2:31:21 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: do a toy analysis
[6/28/17, 2:31:22 PM] Philip Chang: Yeah
[6/28/17, 2:31:27 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: and a bunch of toy analyses
[6/28/17, 2:31:31 PM] Philip Chang: And learn the rule of thumbs
[6/28/17, 2:31:33 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: an analysis on analyses

[6/28/17, 2:31:46 PM] Philip Chang: I like
[6/28/17, 2:31:52 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: could be in the methods and instrumentations journal
[6/28/17, 2:32:07 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: cms is doing things like feed bdt into bdt etc
[6/28/17, 2:32:13 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: i want to see what you gain etc
[6/28/17, 2:32:18 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: btagging a mess like that too
[6/28/17, 2:32:47 PM] Philip Chang: which toy example do we start
[6/28/17, 2:32:59 PM] Tae Min Hong Tae Min Hong: VBF WW vs. ttbar, WW
